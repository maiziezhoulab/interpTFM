MIS1011:

Step 2 — Biological Interpretation (Gene-level)

Goal: See what biology drives each interpretable unit — “what is this latent dimension about?”

Approach

Take the top-N cells (e.g., 5% or 10%) with the highest activation for a given unit.

Compute mean z-scored expression profile for these cells.

Compare to population mean → differential expression (Δz).

Run pathway or GO enrichment (e.g., gseapy / enrichr / GOATOOLS) on the top upregulated genes.

Optional: correlate each unit’s activation vector with expression of known markers.

Expected output

Heatmap of Δz for top units × top marker genes.

Table of top enriched pathways per unit (e.g., “T-cell activation”, “ECM remodeling”, etc.).

These explain the biological theme of each high-MIS unit.

Must-do (high impact, low overhead)

Cell-type specificity audit (per unit):
Recompute enrichment after excluding tumor cells, and again using only tumor cells. Report Δ(log2 OR) and Δ(adj-p) for key terms. If signals persist in non-tumor, you’ve got microenvironment biology; if they persist in tumor-only, it supports tumor-intrinsic programs.

Donor/batch stratification (already partly done):
Recompute MIS and enrichment within each donor; meta-analyze with a random-effects model. Add a “donor consistency” column (e.g., % donors with adj-p<0.05 & same direction).

Threshold sensitivity:
Repeat the analysis at top 2.5% / 5% / 10% high-activation. Keep terms that are stable across ≥2 thresholds and pass your ≥10% overlap ratio rule.

Null/perm tests:
(i) Shuffle unit activations within cell type; (ii) rotate A with an orthonormal random basis; (iii) enrich with random gene lists matched for length and expression deciles. Estimate empirical FDR and report it alongside Enrichr FDR.
